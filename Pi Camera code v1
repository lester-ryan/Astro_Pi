# Take a picture every minute for 3 hours, saved in current work directory, 03d ensures each picture is saved in 3 digit(d) format    
# this uses the sleep functionality to delay each photo by 60 seconds so code is executed like so:
# photo *break for 60 sec* photo *break for 60 sec* and so on for 3 hours


# photos will be saved as 001.jpg 002.jpg etc
